# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data correctly even after successful API fetching.  The bug is present in `bug.js` and a solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

**Problem:** The `FlatList` remains empty despite the API returning a valid JSON response and the data being stored in the component's state.

**Solution:** The solution addresses the likely cause of the issue: improper handling of data updates within `useEffect` and the use of a keyExtractor that's not reliably unique.
